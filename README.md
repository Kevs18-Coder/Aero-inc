# Creative Web Project — by Mark Kevin P. Ecleo

This is my creative version of my student web development project.  
I kept things simple but added small creative touches like gradients, highlight effects, and a softer layout.

## Pages
- Home (Hero section with highlight)
- About (Simple student intro)
- Creative Features page
- Contact page with JS validation

## What makes it creative
- Light gradients
- Soft layout
- Better spacing
- Student-friendly design

This project is still simple on purpose, just more polished.
